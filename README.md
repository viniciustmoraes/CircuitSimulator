# Circuit Simulation Software

This project aims to develop a circuit simulation tool, capable of interpreting and analyzing the behavior of electrical circuits. The software will be able to construct the equations associated with a given circuit, solve them, and provide the time response of the system. 

The project is being developed as a collaboration between two undergraduate students majoring in electrical engineering. The software will be developed from scratch and will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all levels of users.

## Key Features

- Circuit construction using drag and drop of electronic components
- Ability to analyze resistive circuits with voltage sources
- Time response of the circuit 
- Numerical calculations using C++ language 
- User-friendly interface for circuit construction and analysis

## Future Goals

- Analysis of circuits with differential elements, such as inductors, capacitors and more advanced elements (e.g. transistors and diodes)
- Integration of GUI with the code
