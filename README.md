# CircuitSimulator
This project aims to develop a simulation tool for circuits, capable of interpreting the system, constructing the associated equations and solving them, in order to provide the time response of the system. An interactive GUI will be developed, aiming to permit the construction of circuits be means of drag and drop of electronic components.

Initially, we aim at solving purely resistive circuits with voltage sources. For the next steps, the analysis of circuits with differential elements will be performed.

Numerical calculations will be performed using the C++ language,, while future analysis will determine which tools will be used for the GUI description and integration with the code.
